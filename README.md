# About the Project
## Problem Statment
Heritage Unity Bank (HUB), a mid-sized Nigerian financial institution, has been expanding its retail banking services over the past five years. With Nigeria’s growing middle class and digital banking adoption, HUB introduced several consumer loan products, personal, business, and mortgage loans to increase its customer base and strengthen Nigeria’s economy.
The bank has recently been facing challenges with loan approvals. Many legitimate customers are being denied loans, while some approved loans have defaulted early. 

The manual evaluation system based heavily on human judgment and basic scoring rules has become inefficient and inconsistent. Additionally, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and First Central Credit Bureau have urged the bank to ensure transparency and fairness in loan decisions.

## Objective
- The goal for this project is to help HUB maintain competitiveness and financial stability, leveraging on machine learning and data-driven decision-making to understand the key drivers of loan approval and optimize its risk assessment process.
